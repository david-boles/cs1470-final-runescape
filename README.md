# Git LFS setup:
1. Install git either following the [website](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or, on a Debian-based distro, `sudo apt install git-lfs`.
2. Enable it: `git lfs install`
3. Clone the repository! That's it.
4. If you need to enable LFS for other types of files, see the above link. Before pushing, run `git lfs ls-files` to make sure you set it up correctly.
